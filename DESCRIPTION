Description: There are occasions where you need a piece of HTML with inlined
    styles. A prime example of this is HTML email. By inlining styles you are
    essentially moving the CSS and associated formatting instructions from the
    style block in the head of your document into the body of the HTML. Many
    prominent email clients require inlined styles in HTML email; otherwise a
    received HTML email will be displayed without any styling. This package will
    quickly and precisely perform CSS inlining when given HTML text by making
    use of the JavaScript 'juice' library.
